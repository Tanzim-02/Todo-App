## Using Redux
This application utilizes Redux for state management. Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, providing a central store to manage application state. It helps in managing complex state interactions and enables efficient data flow between components.

The Redux-related code can be found in the redux directory of the project. Actions, reducers, and the store configuration are defined to handle the todo functionality.

Feel free to explore the Redux implementation in the codebase and modify it according to your needs.
